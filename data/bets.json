      "aiReasoning": "Klement’s recent form (7-3, wins over Syhora, Bares) and versatile style give him a clear edge over Just’s aggressive but inconsistent play (6-4, losses to Bares, Postelt). Klement’s adaptability in mid-length rallies, as seen in his 3-2 win over Just (Mar 2025), counters Just’s forehand smashes. Betting Recommendations: Klement Moneyline (-159): +9.14% EV, solid value due to recent form, head-to-head dominance, and versatility.",
