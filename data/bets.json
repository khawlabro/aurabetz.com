      "aiReasoning": "Bet 1 unit on each pick. As long as Lukasz Brzeski doesn't win or get finished in round 1, the bet will be profitable. \n\nPredicted Winner: Ryan Spann, with a 70-75% probability of defeating Łukasz Brzeski.\nAI Reasoning: Spann’s grappling dominance (13 submission wins, 1.5 attempts/15 min) and physical advantages (6’5”, 79” reach) exploit Brzeski’s poor takedown defense (36%) and durability issues (three first-round KO losses in last four fights). Despite Spann’s 1-4 skid and heavyweight debut loss, his submission win over St. Preux (October 2024) and regional advantage in New Orleans bolster his chances. Brzeski’s striking (5.02 strikes/min, 50% accuracy) poses a threat if the fight stays standing, but his 1-5 UFC record and KO vulnerability make an upset unlikely. The odds (-217 Spann, +176 Brzeski) align with Spann’s win probability but undervalue his submission potential.",
